#### 段落原文
"Methods: In this study we used Mendelian Randomization (MR) with genetic variants linked to cathepsins as instrumental variables. Summary data from European ancestry genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) Parkinson's disease (PD) Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) multiple sclerosis (MS) and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as outcomes. We employed inverse variance-weighted (IVW) MR to assess the causal impact of cathepsins on neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Various sensitivity analyses were employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the results followed by heterogeneity test. Multivariable MR (MVMR) analysis was utilized to adjust for potential confounding factors. Additionally reverse MR analysis reinforced the findings of the forward MR analysis."

### 段落润色

#### 段落原文
"Results: The MR analysis indicates that elevated cathepsin H levels associate with increased AD and DLB risk. Conversely cathepsin B levels show a negative correlation with PD risk. In a MVMR analysis with nine cathepsins as covariates effect estimates remain unchanged. Only the positive MR result suggests a weaker causal relationship between cathepsin H and ALS risk. Additionally no causal relationship is found between cathepsins and MS. Reverse MR analysis suggests PD and ALS may reduce cathepsin B levels. MS elevates cathepsin E levels DLB negatively correlates with cathepsin Z levels and there's no reverse causal link between AD and cathepsins."

#### 段落原文
"In recent years researchers have undertaken comprehensive investigations into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases with a heightened focus on the role of cathepsins. Cathepsins represent a class of enzymes responsible for protein breakdown within the biological organism and their activity intricately correlates with the delicate balance of protein degradation and synthesis within cells. In the context of neurodegenerative diseases the abnormal activity of cathepsins and protein degradation is often intricately linked to disease development and neuronal death."

#### 段落原文
"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common degenerative neurocognitive disorder surpassed only by Alzheimer's disease (AD). DLB is characterized by early-onset dementia rapid progression and a significant negative impact on the quality of life [12]. Currently the diagnosis of DLB relies mainly on clinical symptoms and there is a lack of effective biomarkers for early disease detection. Reports indicate elevated mRNA levels of lysosomal cathepsin B and cathepsin D in DLB brain tissues with only an increase in cathepsin B enzymatic activity [13]."
